# Binary Search in Java

## Project Information

- **Name:** Carlos Campos
- **Course:** Java Programming (not sure of the exact class)

## Project Description

This project is a simple Java program that demonstrates the use of a binary search algorithm. The program searches for a specific number in a sorted array and returns its position.

### Programming Concepts and Tools

- **Binary Search Algorithm:** Used to find the position of a target value in a sorted array.
- **Arrays:** The data structure used to hold the sorted list of numbers.
- **Control Structures:** `while` loop and `if-else` statements are used to control the flow of the search.

### Inputs and Outputs

- **Input:** A sorted array of integers and a target integer to search for.
- **Output:** The index of the target value if found, or a message saying it's not in the array.
